This project aims to develop a predictive model for accurately forecasting traffic volume at a specific location and time. Historical traffic data and relevant features like date, time, day of the week, month, and weather conditions are utilized. Machine learning techniques are employed to capture patterns and trends in the data, enabling accurate predictions of future traffic volumes. The best-performing model is the random forest regression, which outperformed other models in all evaluation metrics. However, predicting traffic volume in 2018 proved challenging due to irregular data, highlighting the need for further improvements in data consistency and comparability.

<br>
<img src = "images/ufc_fight.PNG" width = "250"/>
<br>
Predictive modelling was used to find the likelihood of a fighter winning by KO/Submission or by Judge Decision.
• Betting agencies can adjust their odds accordingly.
• Individuals can use this information when betting.
Data was taken from the last 10 years of the Lightweight category and assessed to predict the likelihood of a match resulting in a KO/Submission or Judge Decision.
